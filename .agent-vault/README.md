# Agent Vault

Agent Vault is the repo-local memory layer for this repository. Keep durable context small, linked, and easy to resume.

## Start Here

- [[00_Home/Active_Context|Active Context]]
- [[00_Home/Dashboard|Dashboard]]
- [[00_Home/Roadmap|Roadmap]]
- [[AGENTS|Agent Vault AGENTS]]
- [[07_Templates/Note_Contracts|Note Contracts]]
- [[08_Automation/README|Automation README]]
- CLI: `./.agent-vault/08_Automation/vault`
- Help: `./.agent-vault/08_Automation/vault help`
- Health: `./.agent-vault/08_Automation/vault-doctor`

## Boundaries

- `00_Home/` - routing and current state
- `01_Architecture/` - durable system understanding
- `02_Phases/` - bounded plans and steps
- `03_Bugs/` - defect records
- `04_Decisions/` - durable choices
- `05_Sessions/` - chronological work logs
- `06_Shared_Knowledge/` - stable rules and playbooks
- `07_Templates/` - note contracts and starter shapes
- `08_Automation/` - generators, refreshers, validators, helpers

## Editing Rules

- Keep notes readable in raw Markdown.
- Keep frontmatter and required headings stable.
- Keep human judgment outside replaceable generated blocks.
- Patch targeted sections; avoid whole-file rewrites.
- Prefer links over duplicated prose.
- Use `YYYY-MM-DD` dates.
- Rebuild indexes after meaningful metadata or link changes.

## Note Types

- `home_context` - current operating context
- `home_index` - generated or curated indexes
- `architecture` - durable subsystem knowledge
- `phase` - bounded plans
- `step` - executable units
- `bug` - defect records
- `decision` - durable choices
- `session` - chronological work logs

## Workflow

1. Read [[00_Home/Active_Context|Active Context]].
2. Read the target step and only the linked notes you need.
3. Create a session note before major work.
4. Update notes conservatively while you work.
5. Rebuild indexes after meaningful changes.

## Link Discipline

- Prefer direct note links over copied prose.
- Link the note that owns the fact.
- Add reciprocal links when two notes materially depend on each other.
- Do not let index notes become shadow copies.

## Automation Safety Rules

- Prefer frontmatter updates, generated-block replacement, and targeted section edits.
- Fail closed on malformed structure.
- Preserve unknown frontmatter keys and untouched prose.
- Do not treat home notes or session logs as the only durable source of a fact.
- Run `vault validate-all` after structural changes.
- Run `vault refresh-all-home-notes` after meaningful note changes.

## Commands

- `vault help`
- `vault help create-step`
- `vault create-phase "Workflow Adoption"`
- `vault lookup-code-graph auth --path src/core --exports-only`
- `vault migrate`
- `vault migrate-step-notes`
- `vault refresh-all-home-notes`
- `vault validate-all`
- `vault-doctor`

## Current Assumptions

- This vault is the only Agent Vault for `struct`.
- The vault lives directly at `.agent-vault/`.
- Automation should preserve manual edits over broad rewrites.
