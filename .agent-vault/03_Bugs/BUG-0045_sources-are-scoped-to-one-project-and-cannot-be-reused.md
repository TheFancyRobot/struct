# BUG-0045 - Sources are scoped to one project and cannot be reused

Use one note per bug. Capture reproduction, impact, root cause, workaround, and verification, then link back to the relevant phase, step, decision, or session. See [[07_Templates/Note_Contracts|Note Contracts]].

## Summary

- Sources are scoped to one project and cannot be reused.
- Related notes: [[02_Phases/Phase_10_v1_usable_research_workspace/Steps/Step_03_deliver-source-catalog-and-non-blocking-import|STEP-10-03 Deliver Source Catalog and Non Blocking Import]].

## Observed Behavior

- Describe what actually happens.

## Expected Behavior

- Describe what should happen instead.

## Reproduction Steps

1. List the exact setup state.
2. List the user or developer actions.
3. Record the observed result.

## Scope / Blast Radius

- List affected packages, commands, integrations, environments, or users.

## Suspected Root Cause

- Record current theories and assumptions.

## Confirmed Root Cause

- Record the proven cause and decisive evidence.
- `sources.project_id` served simultaneously as ownership, authorization, and catalog visibility. Every derived-source query inherited that one-project assumption, even though immutable source versions and ingestion artifacts were already reusable.

## Workaround

- Describe any temporary mitigation and remaining risk.

## Permanent Fix Plan

- Describe the intended durable fix.
- Implemented `sources.workspace_id` as tenant ownership plus `project_sources` as the only project membership relation. Imports create one logical source/version/job and an initial attachment; workspace APIs and UI manage additional attachments without reingestion.
- Project catalog, activity, research, citation, finding, dataset, and provenance queries now require workspace ownership and project attachment.

## Regression Coverage Needed

- List tests, fixtures, reproductions, alerts, or docs updates needed.
- Added persistence integration coverage proving one workspace source is listed once, attaches to a second project, becomes visible there, and disappears after detach without another source/version.
- Passed 27 focused API/web/registration tests and 17 affected persistence integration tests, plus typecheck, lint, migration down/up, upgrade migration coverage, and vault doctor.
