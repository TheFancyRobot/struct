# BUG-0089 - Removed source selection notice lacks browser coverage

Use one note per bug. Capture reproduction, impact, root cause, workaround, and verification, then link back to the relevant phase, step, decision, or session. See [[07_Templates/Note_Contracts|Note Contracts]].

## Summary

- Removed source selection notice lacks browser coverage.
- Related notes: [[02_Phases/Phase_10_v1_usable_research_workspace/Steps/Step_07_complete-responsive-accessibility-and-theme-behavior|STEP-10-07 Complete Responsive Accessibility and Theme Behavior]], [[05_Sessions/2026-07-28-204323-complete-responsive-accessibility-and-theme-behavior-codex|SESSION-2026-07-28-204323 Codex session for Complete Responsive Accessibility and Theme Behavior]].
- **Gap:** The live browser suite does not prove the warning shown when a previously selected source stops being ready and is removed from the question.
- **Expected regression:** Change a selected source readiness during a conversation and assert the `role=status` notice, reconciled selection, draft preservation, and theme/responsive screenshots.
- **Evidence:** `.local/ui-audit/inventory.md` coverage gaps; component logic has unit coverage only.
