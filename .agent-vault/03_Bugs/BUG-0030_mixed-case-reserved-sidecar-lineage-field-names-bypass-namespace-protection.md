# BUG-0030 - Mixed-case reserved sidecar lineage field names bypass namespace protection

Use one note per bug. Capture reproduction, impact, root cause, workaround, and verification, then link back to the relevant phase, step, decision, or session. See [[07_Templates/Note_Contracts|Note Contracts]].

## Summary

- Mixed-case reserved sidecar lineage field names bypass namespace protection.
- Related notes: [[02_Phases/Phase_04_structured_datasets_and_deterministic_sql/Steps/Step_02_implement-parquet-materialization-and-data-profiling|STEP-04-02 Implement Parquet Materialization and Data Profiling]].

## Observed Behavior

- Describe what actually happens.

## Expected Behavior

- Describe what should happen instead.

## Reproduction Steps

1. List the exact setup state.
2. List the user or developer actions.
3. Record the observed result.

## Scope / Blast Radius

- List affected packages, commands, integrations, environments, or users.

## Suspected Root Cause

- Record current theories and assumptions.

## Confirmed Root Cause

- Record the proven cause and decisive evidence.
The sidecar uses case-sensitive `startsWith('__struct_')` checks when rejecting caller schema fields and projecting reserved Parquet columns out of query views. DuckDB identifiers are case-insensitive, so a mixed-case field such as `__STRUCT_RECORD_ID` bypasses both checks, which violates the reserved-namespace and visibility contract.

## Workaround

- Describe any temporary mitigation and remaining risk.

## Permanent Fix Plan

- Describe the intended durable fix.

## Regression Coverage Needed

- List tests, fixtures, reproductions, alerts, or docs updates needed.

## Timeline

<!-- AGENT-START:bug-timeline -->
- 2026-07-22 - Reported.
- 2026-07-22 - Resolved with a case-insensitive reserved-prefix predicate shared by request validation and query-view projection.
- 2026-07-22 - Verified by rejecting `__STRUCT_RECORD_ID` input schemas and hiding that mixed-case field in a legacy Parquet artifact (4/4 integration tests passed).
