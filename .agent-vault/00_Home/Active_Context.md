# Active Context

Keep this note short and current.

## Current Objective

<!-- AGENT-START:current-focus -->
_Last refreshed: 2026-07-19._
- Session in progress: none.
- Current step: [[02_Phases/Phase_05_typed_research_planning_and_bounded_execution/Steps/Step_01_define-typed-research-plan-and-execution-schemas|STEP-05-01 Define Typed Research Plan and Execution Schemas]] - status: planned - phase: [[02_Phases/Phase_05_typed_research_planning_and_bounded_execution/Phase|Phase 05 typed research planning and bounded execution]]
- Active phase: [[02_Phases/Phase_05_typed_research_planning_and_bounded_execution/Phase|PHASE-05 Typed Research Planning and Bounded Execution]] - status: planned - updated: 2026-07-17
- Also active: 47 more additional steps.
<!-- AGENT-END:current-focus -->

## Repo Snapshot

- Repository: \`struct\`
- Shape: Bun workspace monorepo (apps + packages)
- Core stack: Bun 1.3.13, TypeScript 7.0.2, Effect 3.22.0, SolidJS 1.9.14, Vite 8.1.5, Tailwind 4, DaisyUI 5
- Primary references: [[01_Architecture/System_Overview|System Overview]] and [[01_Architecture/Code_Map|Code Map]]

## In Scope Right Now

- Phase 02 is completed and merged through STEP-02-06 with deterministic retrieval, exact provenance, bounded core-Fred document research, SolidJS citation navigation, and injection-resistance evaluation.
- Phase 03 and STEP-03-01 through STEP-03-06 are completed and merged.
- Phase 04 and STEP-04-01 through STEP-04-06 are completed and merged.
- STEP-04-01 is merged. STEP-04-02 is implemented on its dedicated branch and is undergoing PR review and remediation.
- Keep Bun as the sole host runtime. DuckDB belongs only in its pinned, authenticated, no-egress Docker Compose sidecar.

## Out Of Scope Right Now

- A second runtime, queue, database, filesystem service, client state framework, or Fred executor.
- STEP-04-03 and later work until STEP-04-02 is reviewed and merged.
- Later-phase release work.

## Working Assumptions

- This repo uses one vault at \`.agent-vault/\`.
- The vault does not contain a nested project folder.
- Notes stay readable in raw Markdown.

## Blockers

<!-- AGENT-START:blockers -->
- No phase, step, or session notes are currently marked blocked.
<!-- AGENT-END:blockers -->

## Open Questions

- No unresolved design question blocks STEP-04-02 review and merge.

## Critical Bugs

<!-- AGENT-START:critical-bugs -->
- No open sev-1 or sev-2 bugs are currently recorded.
<!-- AGENT-END:critical-bugs -->

## Next Actions

- Complete review remediation and merge [[02_Phases/Phase_04_structured_datasets_and_deterministic_sql/Steps/Step_02_implement-parquet-materialization-and-data-profiling|STEP-04-02 Implement Parquet Materialization and Data Profiling]].
- Do not begin STEP-04-03 until STEP-04-02 is merged and the zero-defect gate is green.
- Keep every later step sequential: self-review, PR, bot remediation, merge to `main`, then advance.
