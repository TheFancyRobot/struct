# Active Context

Keep this note short and current.

## Current Objective

- Session in progress: none.
- Current step: [[02_Phases/Phase_08_citation_backed_reports_and_durable_findings/Steps/Step_06_evaluate-report-fidelity-version-drift-and-auditability|STEP-08-06 Evaluate Report Fidelity Version Drift and Auditability]] - status: planned - phase: [[02_Phases/Phase_08_citation_backed_reports_and_durable_findings/Phase|Phase 08 citation backed reports and durable findings]]
- Active phase: [[02_Phases/Phase_08_citation_backed_reports_and_durable_findings/Phase|PHASE-08 Citation-Backed Reports and Durable Findings]] - status: in_progress - owner: Codex - updated: 2026-07-20

## Repo Snapshot

- Repository: \`struct\`
- Shape: Bun workspace monorepo (apps + packages)
- Core stack: Bun 1.3.13, TypeScript 7.0.2, Effect 3.22.0, SolidJS 1.9.14, Vite 8.1.5, Tailwind 4, DaisyUI 5
- Primary references: [[01_Architecture/System_Overview|System Overview]] and [[01_Architecture/Code_Map|Code Map]]

## In Scope Right Now

- Phase 02 is completed and merged through STEP-02-06 with deterministic retrieval, exact provenance, bounded core-Fred document research, SolidJS citation navigation, and injection-resistance evaluation.
- Phase 03 and STEP-03-01 through STEP-03-06 are completed and merged.
- Phase 04 and STEP-04-01 through STEP-04-06 are completed and merged.
- Phase 05 and STEP-05-01 through STEP-05-06 are completed and merged.
- Phase 06 is completed, reviewed, and merged through STEP-06-06.
- Phase 07 is complete and merged. Phase 08 is refined and its first lifecycle-contract step is complete, independently validated, and ready for publication.
- Keep Bun as the sole host runtime. DuckDB belongs only in its pinned, authenticated, no-egress Docker Compose sidecar.

## Out Of Scope Right Now

- A second runtime, queue, database, filesystem service, client state framework, or Fred executor.
- Later-phase release work.

## Working Assumptions

- This repo uses one vault at \`.agent-vault/\`.
- The vault does not contain a nested project folder.
- Notes stay readable in raw Markdown.

## Blockers

<!-- AGENT-START:blockers -->
- No phase, step, or session notes are currently marked blocked.
<!-- AGENT-END:blockers -->

## Open Questions

- No unresolved design question or confirmed defect remains in STEP-07-06.

## Critical Bugs

<!-- AGENT-START:critical-bugs -->
- No open sev-1 or sev-2 bugs are currently recorded.
<!-- AGENT-END:critical-bugs -->

## Next Actions

- Publish and merge the completed report-lifecycle contract, then execute the citation-validation and provenance-graph step on its own branch.
- Keep every later step sequential: self-review, PR, bot remediation, merge to `main`, then advance.
